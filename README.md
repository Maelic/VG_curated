# Code for the paper Fine-Grained is Too Coarse: A Novel Data-Centric Approach for Efficient Scene Graph Generation

### Presented at the [SG2RL Workshop](https://sg2rl.github.io/index.html) (ICCV 2023)

#### Paper pre-print is available [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18668.pdf)

#### Code including dataset curation algorithms and data analytics will be released soon, stay tuned.

VG150_curated.zip is the VG150 curated version presented in the paper, while VG150_connected.zip is the VG150 connected version. To use these annotations, follow instructions from [Scene Graph Benchmark](https://github.com/KaihuaTang/Scene-Graph-Benchmark.pytorch) for dataset pre-processing (download the images etc) and replace the VG-SGG.h5 file and VG-SGG-dicts.json with the curated or connected version.
